# World happiness and GDP

Does happiness depend on money?  Using data from the World Happiness Report, from 2004 to 2023, we seek to find a relationship between happiness and other socio-economic factors including GDP per capita.  We modeled happiness as a function of GDP, corruption, and life expectancy for all countries represented in the Report.  A country's GDP per capital has a strong positive relationship to the country's happiness.
